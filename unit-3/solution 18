18. Replace values less than the mean of a numeric vector with NA.

# Create a numeric vector
numeric_vector <- c(1, 5, 3, 7, 9)

# Calculate the mean of the vector
mean_value <- mean(numeric_vector)

# Replace values less than the mean with NA
new_vector <- ifelse(numeric_vector < mean_value, NA, numeric_vector)
print(new_vector)  # Values less than the mean are replaced with NA
