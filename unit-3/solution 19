19. Compare two strings alphabetically using relational operators.




# Define two strings
string1 <- "apple"
string2 <- "Banana"

# Comparing strings alphabetically using relational operators
is_less_than <- string1 < string2
is_equal <- string1 == string2

# Print results
print(is_less_than)  # TRUE because "apple" comes before "Banana" alphabetically
print(is_equal)  # FALSE because the strings are different

# Explanation:
# R compares strings based on their ASCII values. 
# In ASCII, lowercase letters come after uppercase ones, so "apple" is considered smaller than "Banana".
# This is why "apple" < "Banana" returns TRUE.
