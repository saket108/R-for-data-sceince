17. Perform element-wise logical AND, OR, and NOT operations on two logical vectors.



# Create two logical vectors
logical_vector1 <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
logical_vector2 <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)

# Element-wise logical AND operation
and_result <- logical_vector1 & logical_vector2
print(and_result)  # Performs AND operation element-wise

# Element-wise logical OR operation
or_result <- logical_vector1 | logical_vector2
print(or_result)  # Performs OR operation element-wise

# Element-wise logical NOT operation on the first vector
not_result <- !logical_vector1
print(not_result)  # Performs NOT operation on each element of the first vector
