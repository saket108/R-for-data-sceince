#25. Conditional Vector Transformation:
Convert the vector c(3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2) into a vector of only 2s, using a vector of length 2. Which
vectorized operations in R would facilitate this conversion?


> ori<-c(3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2)
> 
> replacing<-c(2)
> 

> new_vec<-replacing[1]+ori*0
> new_vec
[1] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
